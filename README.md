# Testing with RSpec

This is an example app for the [Testing with RSpec](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec) CodeSchool course.

Not intended to be run as a web app, but simply used to run specs.
Examples are focused on showing RSpec's API to people completely new to RSpec.
Some examples may be contrived and don't necessarily promote best testing practices.

# Running specs

* Install dependencies via `bundle`
* Setup database via `rake db:setup`
* Prepare test database via `rake db:test:prepare`
* Run specs via `rspec`
